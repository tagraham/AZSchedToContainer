## 2025-09-14: Educational Approach Strategy

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Educational Design
**Stakeholders:** Tutorial Designer, Target Learners

### Decision

Use a simple "hello world" executable to teach complex containerization concepts rather than building a complex business application.

### Context

When teaching containerization, developers often get distracted by application complexity and miss the core DevOps concepts. Many tutorials either oversimplify (just "docker run hello-world") or overcomplicate (full e-commerce applications).

### Rationale

1. **Focus on Learning Objectives:** Keeps attention on containerization, not business logic
2. **Real-World Simulation:** Simple app can simulate complex deployment scenarios
3. **Transferable Skills:** Concepts learned apply to any .NET application
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Learners can focus on Docker/Azure concepts
5. **Faster Iteration:** Quick builds allow more experimentation

## 2025-09-14: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technology
**Stakeholders:** Tutorial Designer, Enterprise Developers

### Decision

Use .NET 8.0, Docker, Azure Container Apps, and GitHub Actions as the primary technology stack.

### Context

Need a technology stack that represents modern enterprise practices while being accessible to beginners and having strong educational resources.

### Rationale

1. **.NET 8.0:** LTS version with excellent container support
2. **Docker:** Industry standard, extensive documentation
3. **Azure Container Apps:** Modern serverless containers, easier than AKS
4. **GitHub Actions:** Free, well-documented, Azure-integrated

## 2025-09-14: Phase-Based Learning Structure

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Educational Design
**Stakeholders:** Tutorial Designer, Learning Experience

### Decision

Structure the tutorial in 4 distinct phases: Create Executable → Docker Setup → Containerize → Cloud Deploy.

### Context

Adult learners need clear milestones and the ability to stop/resume learning. Complex topics require scaffolded learning approaches.

### Rationale

1. **Clear Milestones:** Each phase has concrete deliverables
2. **Incremental Complexity:** Builds knowledge progressively
3. **Flexible Learning:** Can pause between phases
4. **Troubleshooting Focus:** Isolated phases easier to debug
5. **Real-World Workflow:** Mirrors actual development process

## 2025-09-14: Troubleshooting-First Documentation

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Documentation Strategy
**Stakeholders:** Tutorial Designer, Learner Success

### Decision

Include troubleshooting sections, common pitfalls, and "tips and tricks" in every instruction file rather than separate troubleshooting documentation.

### Context

Containerization has many potential failure points. Learners get frustrated when things don't work and there's no immediate guidance.

### Rationale

1. **Immediate Help:** Solutions available when problems occur
2. **Proactive Learning:** Prevent common mistakes before they happen
3. **Real-World Preparation:** Enterprise development requires troubleshooting skills
4. **Confidence Building:** Learners feel supported throughout the process
5. **Knowledge Retention:** Context-aware learning improves retention

## 2025-09-14: Alpine Linux Base Images

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Security & Performance
**Stakeholders:** Tutorial Designer, Security Best Practices

### Decision

Use Alpine Linux as the base for all container images rather than Ubuntu or Windows containers.

### Context

Container security and performance are critical in enterprise environments. Educational tutorials should teach best practices from the beginning.

### Rationale

1. **Security:** Minimal attack surface
2. **Performance:** Smaller images, faster deployments
3. **Industry Standard:** Most .NET containerization uses Alpine
4. **Resource Efficiency:** Lower memory and storage requirements
5. **Educational Value:** Teaches production-ready practices

## 2025-09-14: Local-First Development

**ID:** DEC-006
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Development Experience
**Stakeholders:** Tutorial Designer, Developer Experience

### Decision

Ensure every phase works locally before moving to cloud deployment, with Docker Compose for local testing.

### Context

Cloud development cycles are slow and expensive. Developers need fast feedback loops for learning and experimentation.

### Rationale

1. **Fast Feedback:** Immediate testing without cloud delays
2. **Cost Effective:** No cloud costs during development
3. **Offline Learning:** Can work without internet connection
4. **Debugging:** Easier to troubleshoot locally
5. **Confidence Building:** Working locally before cloud deployment
