> Last Updated: 2025-09-14
> Version: 1.0.0
> Type: Educational Tutorial Project

## Educational Vision

This project is a comprehensive tutorial designed to teach developers how to migrate Windows executables to modern containerized environments, specifically Azure Container Apps. Through a practical "hello world" example, learners will understand the complete journey from traditional Windows scheduled tasks to cloud-native containerized solutions.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: .NET developers new to containerization
- **Secondary**: DevOps engineers learning Azure Container Apps
- **Tertiary**: Enterprise developers planning legacy system migrations

## The Learning Problem

Many enterprise developers struggle with:
- Understanding Docker containerization concepts
- Migrating Windows-based scheduled jobs to the cloud
- Setting up proper CI/CD pipelines for containerized applications
- Troubleshooting containerization issues in real-world scenarios

## Educational Differentiators

- **Hands-on Learning**: Build a real working example from scratch
- **Phase-by-Phase Approach**: Clear progression from simple to complex
- **Real-World Context**: Simulates enterprise migration scenarios
- **Troubleshooting Focus**: Includes common pitfalls and solutions
- **Cloud-Native Outcome**: Ends with production-ready Azure deployment

## Key Learning Outcomes

By completing this tutorial, learners will:
- Create and containerize .NET executables
- Understand Docker best practices for .NET applications
- Deploy containerized applications to Azure Container Apps
- Implement CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Troubleshoot common containerization issues
- Apply enterprise-grade security and monitoring practices

## Project Scope

This tutorial uses a simple "hello world" executable to simulate complex enterprise scenarios, focusing on the containerization and deployment process rather than application complexity. This approach allows learners to concentrate on DevOps and cloud concepts without being distracted by business logic complexity.
