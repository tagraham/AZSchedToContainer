# Task Completion Summary

## Date: 2025-09-14
## Spec: Phase 1 - .NET Console Application with Instance Management

### ✅ Completed Tasks

All 5 major tasks and 26 subtasks have been successfully completed:

1. **Set up .NET console application project structure** ✅
   - Created .NET 8.0 console application with all required NuGet packages
   - Configured dependency injection using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
   - Implemented structured logging with container-optimized settings
   - Created async Main method with proper error handling

2. **Implement instance management system** ✅
   - Created InstanceManager with both mutex and file-based locking
   - Implemented immediate mutex check with WaitOne(0)
   - Added comprehensive resource cleanup in try-finally blocks
   - Configured exit code 2 for instance conflicts

3. **Add configuration and command-line argument handling** ✅
   - Implemented System.CommandLine for argument parsing
   - Added --sleep-seconds, --instance-name, --enable-file-lock, --log-level options
   - Configured environment variable overrides
   - Added configuration validation with clear error messages

4. **Implement job execution with sleep simulation** ✅
   - Created JobExecutor with configurable sleep duration
   - Added comprehensive logging at all lifecycle points
   - Implemented graceful shutdown handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT
   - Added cancellation token support with periodic checks

5. **Final integration and testing** ✅
   - Created comprehensive test suite with XUnit and Moq
   - Documented all features in detailed README
   - Implemented completion markers for job tracking

### 🎯 Key Features Delivered

1. **Singleton Instance Management**
   - Prevents concurrent executions using named mutex
   - Fallback to file-based locking for compatibility
   - Clear logging when instance conflicts occur
   - Exit code 2 for instance already running

2. **Configurable Sleep Simulation**
   - Command-line argument: --sleep-seconds
   - Environment variable override: SLEEP_DURATION_SECONDS
   - Progress logging for long-running jobs
   - Cancellation support during sleep

3. **Production-Ready Features**
   - Structured logging with timestamps
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Meaningful exit codes (0, 1, 2, 3)
   - Completion markers for job tracking
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **Container Optimization**
   - Console output without colors
   - UTC timestamps throughout
   - Linux-x64 runtime identifier
   - Environment variable configuration

### 📊 Technical Implementation Details

- **Framework**: .NET 8.0
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
- **Logging**: Microsoft.Extensions.Logging with Console provider
- **Command-Line**: System.CommandLine beta
- **Testing**: XUnit with Moq for mocking
- **Locking**: System.Threading.Mutex and FileStream exclusive locks

### 🔍 Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic execution
dotnet run

# Long-running job simulation
dotnet run -- --sleep-seconds 300

# Multiple instance test
# Terminal 1:
dotnet run -- --sleep-seconds 60
# Terminal 2 (will exit with code 2):
dotnet run

# Different instance name (will run):
dotnet run -- --instance-name OtherJob

# File-based locking
dotnet run -- --enable-file-lock

# Debug logging
dotnet run -- --log-level Debug
```

### 📝 Next Steps

The application is now ready for:
1. **Phase 2**: Docker containerization
2. **Phase 3**: Container execution and testing
3. **Phase 4**: Azure Container Apps deployment

The foundation is solid with all enterprise patterns implemented:
- Dependency injection
- Structured logging
- Graceful shutdown
- Resource management
- Comprehensive testing

### ✨ Success Metrics

- ✅ All 26 subtasks completed
- ✅ Test coverage for critical components
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Production-ready error handling
- ✅ Container-optimized configuration
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
