# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Phase 1 - .NET Console Application with Instance Management
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Implement a .NET 8.0 console application that simulates a scheduled job with configurable sleep duration to simulate long-running processes. The application will include singleton instance management to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously, ensuring that new instances detect running processes and gracefully exit.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story: Scheduled Job Developer

As a developer migrating scheduled Windows tasks to containers, I want to create a robust console application with instance management, so that I can prevent resource conflicts and ensure job completion integrity.

The workflow involves starting the application with configurable parameters, having it check for existing instances using a mutex or file lock mechanism, and either proceeding with execution if no instance is running or gracefully exiting if another instance is detected. The application will simulate long-running work through configurable sleep periods, provide detailed logging of all operations, and properly clean up resources upon completion.

### Secondary User Story: DevOps Engineer

As a DevOps engineer, I want to test long-running job scenarios, so that I can validate container behavior and resource management before production deployment.

This involves configuring different sleep durations to simulate various workload scenarios, monitoring instance management through detailed logs, and verifying that the singleton pattern works correctly in both local and containerized environments.

## Spec Scope

1. **Console Application Structure** - Create a .NET 8.0 console application with dependency injection and structured logging
2. **Instance Management System** - Implement singleton instance detection using named mutex or file-based locking
3. **Configurable Sleep Simulation** - Add command-line arguments and configuration for adjustable sleep duration to simulate long-running processes
4. **Comprehensive Logging** - Implement detailed logging for instance detection, job execution, and resource cleanup
5. **Graceful Shutdown Handling** - Ensure proper cleanup of locks and resources on both normal and abnormal termination

## Out of Scope

- Database connections or external service integrations
- Complex business logic beyond sleep simulation
- Web API endpoints or HTTP interfaces
- Distributed locking across multiple machines
- Advanced scheduling logic (handled by container platform)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A working .NET 8.0 console application that can be run with `dotnet run` and accepts sleep duration as a parameter
2. Successful prevention of multiple instances with clear log messages showing when a new instance detects an existing one and exits
3. Configurable sleep duration via command-line arguments (e.g., `--sleep-seconds 60`) with proper logging of the configured duration
