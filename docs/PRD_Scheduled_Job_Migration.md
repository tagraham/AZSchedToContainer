**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements and implementation strategy for migrating a complex, scheduled reporting application from a traditional executable to a cloud-native containerized solution using Azure Container Apps. The document provides technical specifications, deployment strategies, and a rationale for the recommended platform choice.

## 1. Business Context & Objectives

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Our organization currently runs a complex, multi-threaded reporting application as a scheduled Windows executable. This legacy approach presents several challenges:
- Limited scalability and resource management
- Difficult deployment and maintenance processes
- Lack of cloud-native observability and monitoring
- Dependency on traditional infrastructure

### 1.2 Business Objectives
- **Modernize** the reporting infrastructure to leverage cloud-native capabilities
- **Reduce** operational overhead and maintenance costs
- **Improve** reliability and scalability of scheduled jobs
- **Enable** flexible resource allocation and scheduling management
- **Maintain** existing business logic with minimal code changes

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- 100% successful execution rate during testing period
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
- 50% reduction in operational maintenance time
- Cost optimization through serverless consumption model

                // Ensure directory exists
                Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(logFilePath));

                // Write to log file
                await File.AppendAllTextAsync(logFilePath, logMessage + Environment.NewLine);

        private static async Task ExecuteReportingTasks()
        {
            // Placeholder for actual reporting logic
            // This would include database queries, data processing,
            // report generation, and distribution
            await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate work
            Console.WriteLine("Reporting tasks completed");
        }

| **Execution Time** | 10-minute timeout (Consumption) | Multi-hour processing windows |
| **Resource Allocation** | Limited CPU/Memory control | Guaranteed resources for complex operations |
| **Runtime Environment** | Sandboxed, stateless | Full container control for dependencies |
| **Threading Model** | Limited multi-threading | Extensive parallel processing |
| **Deployment Model** | Function-based | Existing monolithic application |

### 5.2 Azure Container Apps Advantages

**1. Workload Suitability**
- Designed for long-running, complex jobs
- Full container runtime without restrictions
- Native support for existing .NET applications

**2. Scheduling Flexibility**
- Platform-level CRON scheduling
- Schedule changes without redeployment
- Built-in retry and timeout configurations

**3. Resource Management**
- Explicit CPU and memory allocation
- Guaranteed resources during execution
- Auto-scaling capabilities when needed

**4. Operational Benefits**
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Managed infrastructure
- Consumption-based pricing model

**5. Migration Path**
- Minimal code changes required
- Lift-and-shift friendly
- Container portability for future migrations
